# Railway Project Viewer

Railway Project Viewer is a React web application that allows users to view projects and manage their services using Railway's API. Users can authenticate with their Railway API token, view their project list, and interact with services like deploying or deleting them.

## Features
- **User Authentication:** Log in using a Railway API token.
- **Project Overview:** Display a list of projects associated with the authenticated Railway account.
- **Service Management:** View services under each project, create new services, and manage existing ones (deploy, delete).
- **Real-time Updates:** Polling mechanism for checking service status updates every few seconds.
  
## Running locally
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have Node.js (>= 14.x.x) and npm (>= 6.x.x) installed.
- A valid [Railway API token](https://docs.railway.app/guides/public-api) (available from your Railway account settings).
  
1. **Clone the repository:**

   - You can get a token from your [Railway account](https://railway.app/account/tokens).

npm test
```
